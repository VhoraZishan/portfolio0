    ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zishan â€” a fast-learning and highly curious Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in backend development, DevOps, and cloud infrastructure. I'm currently diving deep into these fields, eager to understand how scalable, secure systems are built and maintained in the real world.<br><br>

I enjoy solving complex problems, breaking down technical challenges, and picking up new tools and technologies along the way. Whether itâ€™s scripting backend logic, understanding CI/CD pipelines, or learning the intricacies of cloud platforms, Iâ€™m driven by the excitement of making systems work efficiently and reliably.<br><br>

Although Iâ€™m still early in my hands-on journey, Iâ€™m actively building my skill set through experimentation, self-driven learning, and working on projects that align with my career goals. Iâ€™m also open to freelance opportunities that allow me to apply my knowledge, gain experience, and collaborate with others on meaningful technical challenges.<br><br>

I believe in continuous growth, teamwork, and making the most out of every learning opportunity â€” and Iâ€™m looking forward to applying that mindset in real-world environments.
